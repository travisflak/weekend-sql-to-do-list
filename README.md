# Project Name
Weekend SQL ToDo List

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

## Description

For this project I needed to solve the problem of creating a todo list where the user can input types task, who is assigned to a task, what notes are associated with a task, mark if a task is completed (change the container from a grey background to a green background if the task is complete), and have the user be able to delete any task they want to at anytime. All of the associated data needed to be saved to a database and appended to the DOM. 

## Prerequisites

Node.js
express
body-parser

## Installation

1. create a database called tasksToDo.
2.The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal
6. The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. The user fills in the inputs
2. Click the Add To Do button after all inputs have been filled in
3. Click the complete button once the task is completed
4. The user will see the input Complted Y or N change to the color green if they clicked the Completed button
5. The user can delete a to do task at anytime by clicking the DELETE button
6. repeat as needed

## Built With

javascript
